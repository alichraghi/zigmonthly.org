Analytics should always be 100% anonymous, aggregated, open and public - otherwise itâ€™s spying.

Zig monthly's emails are powered by https://buttondown.email, a privacy-centric & GDPR compliant mailing list provider. All tracking capabilities capabilities are turned off in Buttondown, except `?utm_source=` URL parameters (these let people getting traffic through Zig monthly know where it's from.)

We use a self-hosted instance of the open source [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io) server for this:

> By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not set and no personal data is collected. All data is in aggregate only. The website owner gets some actionable data to help them learn and improve, while the visitor keeps having a nice and enjoyable experience.
