<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3173176" alt="slimsag profile picture" width="100px" align="right" style="margin-left: 1rem;"></img> My name is Stephen Gutekanst, I work on video games & developer tools in Zig, but you may also know me from my Go or Sourcegraph work.

## Why?

zigmonthly.org is an idea I've thought about [ever since I had learned about Zig in late 2020](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month#discovering-zig): I noticed how often there were really cool projects in the Zig community obscured behind Discord, Twitter threads, etc.

I began to curate my own bookmarks - collecting interesting projects, things I worried I might not be able to recall easily if I forgot them. Being inside the Zig community feels larger than being outside looking in.

My belief is that there are a ton of people _outside the Zig community_ who are really interested in the language and would love to learn more about what is going on at a higher-level. I want to provide that for them.

## What's the relationship between Zig monthly and zig.news?

[zig.news](https://zig.news) is awesome, it's run by [Loris Cro, VP of community at the Zig Software Foundation](https://kristoff.it) and if you're keen to get news about Zig as it comes out - that's a great place to be!

Zig monthly is a once-a-month publication where I ([@slimsag](https://github.com/slimsag)) curate all the latest Zig things I've seen over the past month from the Zig Discord showcase channels, on zig.news, Twitter, Reddit, etc. and do my best to come up with something that I think faithfully represents everyone.

I had wavered back a forth a bit on whether or not to create Zig monthly at all: there are a _lot_ of challenges (what to feature, how to avoid my own biases, how to make sure it's good for the community and high-quality - while also being sustainable. what tech to use, etc.) With a bit of encouragement from Loris, I finally decided to commit to it.

I'm sure it won't be perfect, so please give me as blunt feedback as you can :)

## Who's behind it?

Just me, a one-person team for now :) I do this on the weekends [among my other Zig work](https://github.com/slimsag).

## How can I help?

* [Submit projects/articles](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJEKosqYa2Mfh7MrZVZ3Krm-65LukUF_AZ4T3VQtTYbBbXtw/viewform), especially if it's from a rarer communication channel or something niche you think others haven't seen yet. Your work and other's work are both fine! I'll curate.
