Why? zigmonthly.org is an idea I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about ever since I had learned about Zig in late 2020: I noticed how often there were really cool projects in the Zig community obscured behind Discord, Twitter threads, etc.
I began to curate my own bookmarks - collecting interesting projects, things I worried I might not be able to recall easily if I forgot them.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye!</title><link>https://zigmonthly.org/goodbye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zigmonthly.org/goodbye/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve been unsubscribed!
Sorry to hear this wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful for you.
I&amp;rsquo;d really like to improve this news letter so that Zig can be as awesome as we&amp;rsquo;re all aspiring for it to be!
